## Prerequisites
It runs on Ubuntu 20.04, and the version below doesn't matter if you install the latest version.

Because SLAM was used in the GPS shaded section, FAST_LIO2 must be installed.

- numpy
- open3d
- opencv
- ultralytics
- FAST_LIO2(SLAM Pacakage)
- morai_msgs
- velodyne_driver

## Inference

```Shell
roscore
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
roslaunch [catkin_ws/'your_directory'] sensor_ready.launch
rosrun [catkin_ws/'your_directory'] state.py
rosrun [catkin_ws/'your_directory'] tracking_planner.py
roslaunch fast_lio mapping_velodyne_morai_launch
rosrun [catkin_ws/'your_directory'] mission_state.py or rosrun [catkin_ws/'your_directory'] mission_state_bon.py
```
